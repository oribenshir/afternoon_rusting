So lately, I had the pleasure to start developing in Rust at my workplace, for what hopefully will turn into a quite extensive library running in production. Another change in my life is the fact I start what is going to be a master's degree in Bioinformatics. The result is that I have a lot to write about Rust, but very little time, which led me to a new and very relevant idea. I'll write a series of short posts with tips, design patterns, and workarounds for common pitfalls when start working with Rust.

I believe the audience for this series is unique in the Rust landscape. The audience is Rust beginners who need to get productive and fast; some of you might even get into Rust, as it is the language your workplace is using. The goal is to provide a set of tools, tips, and design patterns, allowing you to be productive with Rust, and getting their fast.

An important disclaimer is required. The idea is to get productive and fast. Sometimes the solutions are not the most elegant, but they work. Unlike, for instance, learning Data-Driven programming for the next six months, or going through pages and pages of GitHub issues, discussions, blogs, and academic articles only to understand how to create a future with non-static lifetime (a real story).
